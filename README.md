A stupid simple dotfile manager

sprinkle is a very simple dotfile / symlink manager. It is inspired by rcrc and other dotfile managers out there. It is written in rust, and is available as a very compact binary with no dependencies in (releases)[https://github.com/iamruinous/sprinkle/releases/latest].

## Example Config
```toml
debug = false

[sources]
  [sources.friendly_name]
  enabled = true
  path = "~/dotfiles"
  excludes = [
    "README",
    "LICENSE",
  ]

  [sources.another_friendly_name]
  enabled = false
  path = "~/some-other-dir"
```
